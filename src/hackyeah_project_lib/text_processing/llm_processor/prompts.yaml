text_properties_descriptions:
  repetitions: |
    A list of repeating significant words, excluding small words such as 'zł', 'i', 'tak', etc. If such words do not
    occur, leave an empty list.
  list_of_topics: |
    A list of main, general topics discussed in the speech, listed in the order they appear. Each topic should represent
    a broad, overarching theme, encompassing related subtopics. Avoid breaking down into detailed issues; focus on key
    thematic areas of the speech. Provide the topics using polish language.

    - Topics should be general enough to encompass related information presented in the speech.
    - Avoid listing every minor subtopic as a separate topic.
    - If several topics in the response actually pertain to one larger topic or if one topic flows logically into
      another, then include only a single general topic.

    If the speech does not contain clear topics, leave an empty list.
  numbers: |
    A list of numerical values mentioned in the speech, including all integers, years, and quantities. Write them
    exactly as they are written in text. If there are no numbers in the text, leave an empty list.
  jargon: |
    A list of specialized or technical terms used in the speech that may be unfamiliar to people not associated with
    the given industry. This does not include very well-known and commonly used names nor cases where the text precisely
    explains the meaning of the word. If there is no jargon in the text, leave an empty list.
  passive_voice: |
    A list of sentences from the speech that are constructed in the passive voice. In Polish, the passive voice often
    ends with "-no", "-to" (e.g., "zrobiono projekt", "przetworzono dane", "podsumowano artykuł") or uses constructions
    with the verbs "być" or "zostać" + past participle adjective (e.g., "projekt został zatwierdzony", "raport jest
    przygotowywany"). Verbs ending with "-śmy" are not passive voice. If there are no words ending with "-no" or "-to"
    or words like "być", "zostać", then leave an empty list.
  complicated_words: |
    A list of words in the speech that may be incomprehensible to people without higher education or that are not
    commonly used in everyday conversations, potentially making understanding more difficult. If such words do not
    occur in the text, leave an empty list.
  complicated_sentences: |
    A list of sentences in the speech whose meaning may not be obvious, which are poorly constructed, lack information,
    or are very long and lose sense over time, potentially making understanding more difficult. If there are no such
    sentences, leave an empty list.

  extract_text_properties: |
    You are an expert in analyzing spoken Polish text. Based on the received text, you will identify and list the
    following properties: word repetitions, a list of main topics, numbers, jargon, sentences in the passive voice,
    complicated words, and complicated sentences. Each property should be identified according to its definition.
    When identifying topics, focus on the main, general threads, avoiding breaking down into detailed issues. If there
    are no appropriate words or structures in the text, do not invent them—simply provide an empty list.
